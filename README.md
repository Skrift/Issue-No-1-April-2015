Skrift Issue No 1: April 07, 2015

This is an archival repository of Issue No 1 of Skrift, which was originally published at [http://skrift.io/](http://skrift.io/) on April 07, 2015

This month, our inaugural issue, features two very different articles.

[Doug Robar](http://twitter.com/drobar) talks to us about the secrets to living a good life. Adapted from a presentation he gave at both Umbraco UK Festival and uWestFest, his piece is a profound, thoughtful, and life-changing. It’s too easy to get caught up in the office grind, to be pushing for the next code release, and to mistake being busy or being well paid for being successful. He focuses on another metric: a life well lived, and it’s a worthwhile read by anyone alive.

[Dave Woestenborghs](http://twitter.com/dawoe21), who is one of the most talented developers working in Umbraco 7’s new Angular-driven back office, hearkens us back to the good old uComponents days by walking us through nuPickers, a handy new package for handling advanced picker-related scenarios that will crop up frequently on Umbraco sites. There is a lot to learn, but he carefully takes us step by step, leaving no man behind as he presents a solid case for why nuPickers should be part of every Umbraco developer’s toolbox.

A Letter From the Editor by the Skrift team introduces what Skrift is, and who is behind it.

Several links to interesting articles and videos with new ideas, packages, and discussions about Umbraco are also in the issue.
